            HI! 

I'm a natural light photographer here in Austin, Texas.  I grew up in West Texas, but I've pretty much lived in every corner of this state before landing back here. I love hugs (you've been warned!), being outdoors, finding beautiful light and holding a camera. :) I started dating my husband while we were both at college in San Marcos and we've been together since.  He's pretty much the coolest person that I've ever met. We have an amazing son, Kingston, who is coincidentally the inspiration and catalyst behind my photography journey. 

I've always loved expressing my creative side. I was the one with the camera in hand, be it disposable, polaroid, point and shoot, or trying out my dad's 35mm growing up. Once Kingston was born, I purchased my first dslr and it was over. I immersed myself in learning about photography. Reading books, joining forums, self-paced workshops, and tutorials; and I still can't get enough. Now, I'm a licensed Professional Photographer and my intent is to capture real and honest moments. If that speaks to you, then we are probably a great fit together! This is my passion and I'm thrilled at the possibility of being able to meet and capture what is important to you! So go ahead, shoot me an email and let's do this!
